# project-sandwich-man

A project for researching a complex and long-horizon manipulation task especially focused on hierarchically stacking blocks(With this task, we could make a sandwich!).

*STATUS :* [`In Progress`](https://github.com/ropiens/project-sandwich-man/projects/1)

</br>

## Setup

Command `make init` on the project repo.

- the command clone all submodule-dependencies and install all python requirement modules.
- after this command, you should source virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`.

Then, run `make test` to check installation. If setup is succeeded, you can see the below environment.
